            This code of conduct applies to the MW | Frontend community, but if
            you are being harassed by a member of the MW | Frontend community
            outside any community property,{' '}
            <strong>
              I still want to know about it and will do everything in my power
              to help and protect you
            </strong>
            . I will take all good-faith reports of harassment by the MW |
            Frontend community members seriously.
          </p>
          <p>
            This includes harassment outside any community property and
            harassment that took place at any point in time. I reserve the right
            to exclude people from the MW | Frontend community based on their
            past behaviour, including behaviour outside the MW | Frontend
            community and behaviour towards people who are not in the MW |
            Frontend community.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted

          <p>
            I will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of
            protecting victims of abuse. At my discretion, I may publicly name a
            person about whom I’ve received harassment complaints, or privately
            warn third parties about them, if I believe that doing so will
            increase the safety of the MW | Frontend community members or the
            general public. I will not name harassment victims without their
            affirmative consent.

            The MW | Frontend community is place for fellow designers and
            developers to hang out, help each other out, and build networks.

          <h3>What’s Permitted</h3>
          <p>
            I welcome members of this group to share links and resources that
            they think the MW | Frontend community members will benefit from.{' '}
            <strong>
              Make sure the things you’re promoting are genuinely valuable and
              relevant to the community.

          <h3>What’s Not Permitted</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Please refrain from posting repeatedly or without context links to
              pitches, events, products, or services, or any such resources that
              are not specifically on topic for this community. Refrain from
              approaching other members directly with sales pitches.

          </p>
          <h2>Etiquette</h2>
          <p>
            The MW | Frontend community is a friendly community where{' '}
            <strong>all members should feel safe and welcome</strong>. To ensure
            this, please avoid the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Sending unwarranted private messages to other members. Please ask
              permission first.
            </li>
            <li>
              Clogging up the channel with relentless messages that receive no
              response. Read the room.
            </li>
            <li>Conducting yourself in a combative, aggressive nature.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Enforcement</h2>
          <p>
            Participants asked to stop or correct any behaviour violating this
            code of conduct are expected to cooperate immediately, whether asked
            by me or another member of the group.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event this doesn’t occur, I will approach conflicts within
            the following template:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Repeat the request to stop.</li>
            <li>
              If the person doubles down, they will be given an official
              warning.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the behaviour continues or is repeated later, the person will
              be expelled and their membership will be cancelled.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            On top of this, I may remove any offending messages, images,
            contributions, etc., as I deem necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              I reserve full rights to skip any of these steps, at my
              discretion, if the violation is considered to be a serious and/or
              immediate threat to the health and well-being of members of the
              community.
            </strong>{' '}
            These include any threats, serious physical or verbal attacks, and
            other such behaviour that would be completely unacceptable in any
            social setting that puts our members at risk. In some cases, the
            participant may also be identified as a harasser to other MW |
            Frontend community members or the general public.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will prioritise the well-being and comfort of the recipients of
            the violation over the comfort of the violator.
          </p>
          <p>
            That said, I understand that the amygdala makes conflict resolution
            hard, and will approach conflicts with the initial assumption that
            all parties intend well, and will favour education over escalation
            whenever possible.
