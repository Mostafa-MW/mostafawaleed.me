Today, we'll look at focusable pseudo-classes that are supported by current browsers,
but first, let's define focusable and tabbable in the context of CSS.

## Focusable

The keyboard will not focus the element; instead, the script `(element.focus())`
and it is canÂ the mouse or pointer will do so.

## Tabbable

Since it is a component of the document's sequential focus navigation order,
the element will be keyboard focusable. Script and mouse can also be focusable as well as the cursor.

## `:focus-within`

> The `:focus-within` CSS pseudo-class represents an element that has received focus or contains an element that has received focus. In other words, it represents an element that is itself matched by
> the `:focus` pseudo-class or has a descendant that is matched by :focus.

The most common example is changing the `background-color`,
or `border`, of a form when someone goes inside it:

```css
form:focus-within {
  background: pink;
}
```

Here if any of that input children receive focus that this selector will get applied.

## `:focus-visible`

> The `:focus-visible` pseudo-class applies while an element matches the [`:focus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus) pseudo-class and the UA ([User Agent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent)) determines via heuristics that the focus should be made evident on the element. (Many browsers show a "focus ring" by default in this case.)

`:focus-visible` is used in the same way as `:focus` to draw attention to the element that is now in focus.

```css
button:focus:not(:focus-visible) {
  outline: none;
}

button:focus-within {
  outline: 1px solid pink;
  outline-offset: 0.15em;
}
```

The `:focus-visible` When the device/browser (user agent) determines that an outline (or user-defined style) is required, the pseudo-class will show it. This usually implies that it will
appear for keyboard users when they press the `tab` key, but not for mouse users.
